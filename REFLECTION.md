1. Why is version control useful?
Version control lets you track every change you make to your code over time. If you break something, you can go back to a previous version. It also lets multiple people work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
2. What is the difference between staging and committing?
Staging means selecting which changes you want to include in your next save. Committing is the actual act of saving those changes permanently in the history. You stage first, then commit.
3. When should you make a commit?
You should commit whenever you finish a small, meaningful piece of work. A good rule of thumb is that each commit should do one thing and be easy to describe in a short message.
4. What is the difference between git init and git clone?
git init creates a brand new empty repository on your machine. git clone copies an existing repository from somewhere like GitHub onto your machine, including all its history and files.
5. Why should you write good commit messages?
Because when you or someone else looks at the history later, the messages explain what changed and why. A message like "fix bug" tells you nothing, while "fix login error when password contains special characters" is actually useful.
6. What is the purpose of using branches?
Branches let you work on something new without touching the main working version of your code. You can experiment, make changes, and only merge them in when you are confident they work.
7. When would you create a new branch instead of working on main?
Whenever you are adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or trying something experimental. Working directly on main is risky because if something breaks, it affects the entire project immediately.
